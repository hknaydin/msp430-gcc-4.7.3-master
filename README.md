There’s an issue with the msp430-gcc 4.6.3 version of this compiler provided by the
repository, regarding the serial communication. The script used to dump the prints
from the mote, doesn’t work correctly with it.

To fix it, there’s a higher version of the compiler, but it needs to be downloaded
manually.
